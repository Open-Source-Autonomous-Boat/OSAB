# OSAB
#### OSAB stands for Open Source Autonomous Boat
### The goals for this project are as outlined here:
Create an Open Source 3D printed Autonomous Boat for collecting data fromt the ocean for scientific research that anyone can make
### The restraints for this project are as outlined here:
- The boat must be easy to make for the slightly above average maker so no carbon fiber or fiberglass. The boat must be 3d printed but sealants and the like can be used
- The boat must be sea worthy for upto several months at a time without human intervention
- The boat but be self powered for months at a time via solar, wind, fuel, etc, even though the night
- The boat must be able to collect water samples and collect water data such as temp, presure, pH, salinity, etc from down to 500m below the oceans surface (idealy 1000m)
- The boat must be envirnmentaly friendly in the sense that it can not leach anything into the water from anti-corosive paint, etc
