# :boat: Open Source Autonomous Boat (OSAB) 

## :grey_question: What is OSAB?

OSAB is a project that makes open-source, solar powered, autonomous, boats. We are a team of student hobbyists and tinkerers around the world who love STEM, learning, and who care about our planet and global issues such as climate change.

**Why?** For science of course! The data gathered by OSAB includes lux / UV / IR / Visible light, water temp, air temp and humidity, water turbidity, water pH, water salinity, air pressure, and much more. This data will help us better understand ocean and atmospheric environments and let us create a better solution to fight climate change!

## :crystal_ball: Our Vision

Our vision of the future of this project is that it creates a young generation that is not afraid to think big and try things that seem too difficult at first. We want them to see that not everything is perfect and then work to improve the world around them. They will realize that even when the problems are bigger than they can fix alone if they work together to create positive change, no task would be too big or too hard.

## :white_flag: Our Mission

Our mission is to prove that a team of young inspired students can use science, technology, engineering, and math to fight global issues like climate change and create a lasting impact on the world. We want to create positive change in the world and inspire young students to do the same by showing them that anyone can achieve amazing things and make a difference in the world if they try.

## :dart: Our Goal

Our goal is to create positive change through the research and the development of our vessels as research platforms. Although our boats are unlikely to provide that much useful data today, our goal is that our designs and ideas lead to a new generation of mobile, inexpensive, autonomous, ocean platforms for future scientific instruments and data collection. Every smartphone, rocketship, and MRI started out as an idea and a prototype before they became what they are today. We hope to be that stepping stone that leads to a technology that makes the world a better place.
