# About

## :grey_question: What is OSAB?

OSAB is a project that is developing open-source, solar powered, autonomous, boats. We are a team of student hobbyists and tinkerers from around the world who love learning, STEM, and the planet. We care about global issues such as climate change and want to use our skills to develop solutions for the future.

**Why?** For science of course! The data gathered by OSAB vessels will include lux / UV / IR / Visible light, water temperature, air temperature and humidity, water turbidity, water pH, water salinity, air pressure, and much more. This data will help us better understand ocean and atmospheric environments around the world and let us create a better solution to fight climate change!

## :crystal_ball: Our Vision

The future of this project is one that creates a young generation that is not afraid to think big and try new ideas and solutions even if they seem difficult at first. We want them to see the flaws and problems in the world and then take it as a challenge to work to improve the world around them. We hope they will realize that even when the problems are too big for them to fix alone, they can work together with like minded forward thinkers to create positive change no matter how hard the task is.

## :white_flag: Our Mission

Our mission is to prove that a team of young inspired students can use science, technology, engineering, and math to fight global issues like climate change and create a lasting impact on the world. We want to create positive change in the world and inspire young students to do the same by showing them that anyone can achieve amazing things and make a difference in the world if they try.

## :dart: Our Goal

Our goal is to advance climate and earth sciences through the research and development of our vessels and research platforms. Although our vessels are unlikely to provide that much useful data today, our designs and ideas will lead to a new generation of inexpensive, mobile, autonomous, ocean research platforms for future scientific instruments and data collection. Every smartphone, rocketship, and MRI started out as an idea and a prototype before they became lifesaving scientific tools for comunication, research, and medicine. We hope to develop the technology that leads to advancements that solve global issues.

# Repositories

### [OSAB Home](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/)
*This repository.* The `OSAB` repo has general information about the project, information on contributing, resources, , and links to the project repos and websites.

### [Documentation](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/Docs)
The `Docs` repo hosts all the project documentation using github pages. You can find the documentation website [here](https://docs.osab.xyz/).

### [Media Library](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/Media-Library)
The `Media-Library` repo hosts images, screenshots, and videos of the project for anyone to browse or use. Be sure to read the license before downloading and using the images though!

### [Vessel Firmware](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/Vessel-Firmware)
The `Vessel-Firmware` repo has the current prototype firmware for our vessels while we develop a custom modular OS-like firmware for our vessels. In the future, it will be replaced by the new OS firmware and repositories containing each vessel's 'application' firmware to be run on-top of the OS.

### [NavTools](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/NavTools)
`NavTools` is an Arduino library we created that contains various functions for calculations using latitude and longitude, etc.

### [Vessel Instruction Set Language](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/Vessel-Instruction-Set-Language)
The `Vessel-Instruction-Set-Language` repo
