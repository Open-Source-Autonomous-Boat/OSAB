## OSAB Team:

#### Michael MacDonald - Founder, Project Manager, Works on all aspects of the project.
> Hi! I am a college student (oregon state university) from Oregon who loves to tinker with electronics and program microcontrollers. I was a global board member of the Clean My Planet 501(c)3 non-profit (while it still existed) and I still love finding ways to address environmental and climate issues with my engineering skills. In the future, I hope to find a career where I can engineer solutions and work alongside scientists to create tools and solutions to global issues. Whether that is imaging devices for cancer cell research, instruments for climate research, satellite telescopes for astronomy research, or rovers for terrestrial exploration on other planets, I want to contribute to the advancement of science.

#### Sirius - Web Dev, Web Master, Electrical Engineer, Public Relations.
//Hey, I am a high school student from Croatia, my name is Ivan but most know me as Sirius, I like space, electronics, and nature. When I saw this project and what are they aiming to do I was just blown away, and wanted to become a part of the team (which I am now). My role in this project is marketing and some front-end web development. I hope we can make this idea happen and fight climate change and at least try to save our fragile planet!
